Hey there! 👋 I'm the founder of NHCarrigan, **Naomi** — a transfem software engineer, community manager, and (failed) VTuber who's passionate about building inclusive tech communities and breaking down barriers in the industry.

I spend my days building Discord bots, mentoring new developers, and creating tools that make online communities more welcoming and accessible. When I'm not coding, you'll find me working on games, obsessing over sustainability in tech, or trying to figure out why my VTuber dreams didn't pan out (spoiler: it's probably the lack of streaming consistency 😅).

I believe technology should uplift and empower everyone — especially those who've been historically excluded from tech spaces. That's why I focus on ethical, community-driven projects that actually make a difference.

Want to learn more about my work, join a mentorship program, or just hang out with a bunch of awesome people? **Come join me on Discord at [chat.nhcarrigan.com](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com)** — I'd love to meet you! ✨
